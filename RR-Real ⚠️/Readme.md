# 🚨 WARNING: Real Deletion Script (RR-Real.py) 🚨

**⚠️ SEVERE WARNING: DO NOT RUN THIS SCRIPT ON ANY REAL SYSTEM! ⚠️**

This script, **RR-Real.py**, is designed to simulate the deletion of critical system files by attempting to remove them using Python's `os.remove` function. **This action is irreversible** and can lead to complete system failure, data loss, and permanent damage to your operating system.

## IMPORTANT NOTICE

- **📚 Educational Purposes Only:**  
  This script is provided solely for learning, experimentation, and demonstration purposes. It is **not** meant to be executed on any system that contains real or important data.

- **💥 Risk of Permanent Damage:**  
  Running this script on any actual system may permanently delete essential system files, corrupt your operating system, and result in data loss that cannot be recovered.

- **🛡️ Use Only in a Controlled Environment:**  
  If you choose to experiment with this script, do so **exclusively in an isolated and safe environment** (e.g., a virtual machine or sandbox) that contains no critical data or production systems.

## How the Script Works

1. **🖥️ Terminal Size Verification:**  
   The script first ensures that the terminal window is wide enough (at least 104 columns) to display messages correctly.

2. **⚙️ Library Initialization:**  
   It initializes libraries such as `colorama` for colored terminal output and `pygame` for playing an alarm sound.

3. **🔔 Alarm File Check:**  
   The script verifies the existence of an `alarm.wav` file in the same directory. If the file is missing, the script exits immediately.

4. **🗑️ Deletion Process:**  
   - The script compiles a list of critical system file and directory paths based on the operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
   - For each path, it checks if the file or directory exists.
   - If it exists, the script attempts to delete it using `os.remove`, displaying messages for success or errors.
   
   **Note:** This process is irreversible and intended solely to demonstrate how such operations can be performed programmatically.
